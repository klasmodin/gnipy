GNIPY
=====

GNIPY is a software library for [Geometric Numerical Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_integrator) in Python. It supersedes the older package [odepy](https://code.google.com/p/odepy/).

This library contains Python classes and functions to simplify the **implementation**, **evaluation**, and **comparison** of numerical integration algorithms for differential equations. Primary focus is on **simplicity and generality**. Secondary focus is on **efficiency**; the core classes are designed so that efficient code easily can be implemented if necessary. 

History
-------

The first version of the code was developed as a project in a course on scientific computing with Python, given at the Department of Numerical Analysis at Lund University. Since then, the code has been used in various research projects on geometric numerical integration, especially in the context of splitting methods.
